Test-drive some code that manages the stock and orders of a CD
warehouse. Customers can buy CDs, searching on the title and the
artist. Record labels send batches of CDs to the warehouse. Keep a
stock count of how many copies of each title are in the warehouse.
Customers can only order titles that are in stock. Use dependency
injection to fake credit card payment processing, so we can get on
with our CD warehouse design without worrying about how that
will be done.

Customers can leave reviews for CDs theyâ€™ve bought through the
warehouse, which gives each title an integer rating from 1- 10 and
the text of their review if they want to say more
